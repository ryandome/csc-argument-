   My cause is Travel. There are many misconceptions people have when they hear someone say that they enjoy traveling and want to spend their time doing it. They usually think of travel abroad or to major domestic cities. They think of more grandiose trips to exotic places or cultural landmarks. They also think that the person has and/or is willing to spend a lot of money. These things in some cases are true, plenty of people devote themselves to seeing only the more well known cities and landmarks in world. It is also true that at times travel can be somewhat expensive and there are people who do spend a lot to do it.

    These thoughts should not be applied to everyone who says that they want spend their time traveling. Travel does't have to be an eleborate thing where you are gone for an extended period. Traveling can be as simple as you want. There are many people who find value in just traveling within their own state or country. In regards to travel it doesn't even have to be about seeing the most famous or historical places. There are those who simply enjoy something like the outdoors, to them travel can be taking a hike to see something new. There is a misconception that those who talk about traveling a lot have grand ideas about what they want to do and are mainly interested in seeing the most popular destinations. Some people are like this, but for many travel means so much more. It can just be about seeing something new in life whether that is in your own state, country or world.

   To make an effective argument here I found that it was really important to have a clear understanding of what it was that I wanted to argue in favor of. Doing so helped me realize that with my particular topic I wasn't necessarily trying to prove anyone wrong, but rather just open their ideas to thinking about something differently. With this in mind I made sure to acknowledge that the "misconception" people have is not always incorrect. I felt this was important because I don't want to overload them with information in support of my own view and I don't want people's beliefs to be threatened. I feel that this works with regards to my topic because people don't as strong of feelings about this issue as they do with many others.
